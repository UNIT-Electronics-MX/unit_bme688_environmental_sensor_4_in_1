# BME688 Environmental Sensor 4-in-1

## Introduction

The BME688 Environmental Sensor 4-in-1 is a compact and highly integrated sensing solution based on Bosch Sensortec‚Äôs advanced gas sensor technology. Designed for next-generation environmental monitoring, this module simultaneously measures four key parameters: temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and gas presence, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and indoor air quality (IAQ) indicators. By combining multiple sensors in one package, the BME688 reduces design complexity and board space, making it especially suitable for size-constrained applications such as wearables, portable devices, and smart IoT nodes.

The module features digital communication via I¬≤C or SPI interfaces, ensuring seamless integration with microcontrollers and embedded platforms like Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi. Its ultra-low power consumption enables continuous monitoring in battery-operated systems, while its wide operating range and high accuracy support precise environmental data acquisition under dynamic conditions. Furthermore, the gas sensor includes support for AI-based classification of gas mixtures using Bosch‚Äôs BME AI-Studio, opening new possibilities for custom air quality applications.
